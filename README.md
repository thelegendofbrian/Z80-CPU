Z80 CPU
=======

This is the start of a Z80-like CPU, written in VHDL, using Xilinx ISE. The Z80 CPU is a very basic and popular CPU that was used in the GameBoy. My code is a bit unpolished, however, until I get Xilinx working on Windows 8, it will likely stay that way.

Check out the diagram of the CPU under "docs/Flow Chart.pdf"
